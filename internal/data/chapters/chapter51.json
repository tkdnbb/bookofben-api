    "THERE are no gods of the nations, saith the LORD. I have never been formed in stone, nor hath paint found mine image. There shall no one come into my courts with a graven image. Nor shall anyone come to be blessed in the inner court as one that maketh the courses of diverse religions to be blessed. No one shall be blessed of me who supplicateth to krishnim and baalim, and whatsoever idols and gurus they have. The LORD your God is not one among many. I am the LORD, and there is no God beside me. He who cometh to the LORD, cometh to him who IS, and he cometh knowing fully well that there be no God but JHWH.",
    "Herein shalt thou keep mine inner court holy and pure: on the days that thou shalt admit the nations, thou shalt not permit any graven image before me. It is abomination. No embassage shall come before me of the nations to gawk. Thou shalt not make a spectacle of the blessings of the LORD. But thou shalt minister before me in the blessing and the rituals of they who come to appear before the LORD.",
    "Thou shalt not receive money of any suppliant; no donation. Gifts shall be given unto the LORD for the keeping of the courts at another place; and it is another matter whatever. The gold of him who thinketh he buyeth of the LORD shall be a curse to him. And the priest that taketh things for his service shall be cast out into the nations.",
    "For no man keepeth the LORD, and he that bringeth gifts, doth not the LORD also give a portion unto you for your keeping? Therefore ye are kept by me, and ye shall receive nought of payment before the LORD. Take care, lest the LORD see abomination before him."
