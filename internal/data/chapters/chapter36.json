    "BEHOLD, I knock down the pillars and the roof shall fall; I kick out the braces, and the walls give way; I remove the floor from under this generation, that he who standeth by faith may be declared unto this perverse generation.",
    "To him will I look, and I will make him a pillar to come. I will put my heart into his bosom, and my words into his mouth. Even to one as this shall I look favorably: he who standeth by my faith, and shall not yield to the multitude of perverse counsel; that saith not of tradition, “It is the will of God;” or of things wherein man delighteth, “He hath declared it.” The generation that shall come shall call him a prophet and a prince, he who standeth by faith and putteth aside the vanity of this wicked generation; that knoweth and declareth to this people that traditions are the will of God only to those without faith.",
    "I shall strip this generation of its walls and its foundation to see whose faith is in the LORD. I shall strip them as an army defeated is stripped of its armor. And no more shall I be called Idol, and no more shall my words be called Totem; but they shall know me again, and they shall scamper to do my words.",
    "Upon such an one that shall stand by my faith I shall place my name, and he shall declare me his God; and I shall be his God. The evil of the days that shall come shall be as a coward before him. He shall vanquish them as days that are already long forgotten and not to be seen hereafter again.",
    "Faith is a rock indeed, and he shall say of the LORD, “Thou art my mason.” Blessed is the man who saith of me “He Liveth,” and the son of man who saith “He is my rock.” I shall guide his paths, and all the days of his life he shall know that his God liveth."
