    "I DO declare faith unto them that have not faith. Unto them that thought of me not, shall I be as a fountain of life. Faith I shall give as water that a desert may bloom. As a chorus of fine instruments stirreth the soul, so shall I cause a rushing in the heart. The Gentiles shall see thy resurrection, and they shall come forth to life. For faith is life to a body. It is the picked chord from my soul, a highway from mine heart. Faithful am I, saith the LORD. I shall call thee forth and set thee up as aforetime. Death, get thee from me! Away, thou evil affliction and curse of man! The LORD mocketh thee from his heaven.",
    "If thou be plunged within thine iniquities as in a churning torrent, doth it require much faith to know the land shall support thy foot? Stretch forth thine hand. Come from the river crimson and be thou blotted clean by a clean cloth. Be anointed by a fragrant oil and let thy sins be blotted away and left without trace. The LORD shall change thy countenance with a touch, and he shall give thee comfort to abundance.",
    "For the LORD’s wrath caused the whip to crack, and for his glory sake he was far from us. But the LORD’s mercy is everlasting, and his faith the finger that doth pluck the chord to thine heart and cause it to come to life and hum a new song. He doth declare: I shall make thy children as an ancient, and he who hath few days as if he was from the beginning. My ways have not changed, saith the LORD. As a mother loveth her child and as a father kvelleth for his son, so have my ways not changed, and so my ways shall remain forever."
