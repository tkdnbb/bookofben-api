    "YE shall have no waste upon my mount, nor shall ye make waste and cart it from the mount unto the sewers. Ye shall be clean as so much as it be politic. Ye shall not spit; none who cometh shall have an issue from his body; save only tears shall I accept, the washing of the heart. Places shall be provided within the lodgings of the kohenim for they who fulfill their course there, but ye shall not make stalls and places as a part of mine holy house. Let all take care before coming and when going. Places beyond the outer court shall be provided. Sneezes shall be held by hankies; wounds shall be bound.",
    "Someone who becometh ill, seized upon a sudden, shall be taken to medicine. Ye shall provide a place wherein they may be taken in emergency. Ye shall have mercy, and it shall be as a river, yea, a flood, upon my holy mountain. He among the kohenim who saith “I am too holy to have mercy or to touch and be touched in mercy” shall be unclean before me three days. I know the weakness of flesh, and mine eye is upon the maimed, the injured, the distressed, and the aged. Ye shall be holy in all my holy mount.",
    "The priests shall walk the courts, the open places and the cloisters, their ears diligently seeking the distressed, the plaintive and the tearful, and they shall comfort. They shall comfort from the rising of the sun and the setting thereof. In darkness and light, in heat and shadow, shall they perform the mercies of the living God, for my spirit looketh out. It goeth abroad from my holy habitation and scoureth the land, seeing who shall follow the ways of the LORD. Ye stand at my feet, all ye kohenim; be ye holy and circumspect. Ye who are too holy, I shall be too holy for, and ye shall not minister before the LORD JHWH."
