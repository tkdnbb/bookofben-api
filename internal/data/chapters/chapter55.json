    "TAKE care, and guard ye well, in the distribution of judgment, for many nations shall come up to Jerusalem, saying “Let us go up to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, for we shall receive his justice there.” Let the judge put a knife to his throat, and let all they who come be heard. Let them not be silenced from the matter at hand, nor let the courts be run as if a game and a show, for justice is sought of the LORD your God.",
    "Let no case be tried by less than 5, and let them give themselves to prayer and humility before the LORD, to render his judgments, for the name of the LORD is upon thee in that place; and many in the nations and in Israel shall say, “Let us go up to be tried and we shall receive justice from God.” Let no one who cometh to judgment render payment, but the judge shall judge from the heart of the LORD, with his words ever before him. Justice is no business before the LORD, nor cometh judgment by luck of the draw. Unto all an even weight: rich or poor, great or small, handsome or homely, Israel or the nations, for I am the God of all flesh, saith the LORD. And this is judgment before the LORD: equity. There shall be no expedience in judgment, no fad or precedence: precept upon precept, case by case, on the merits thereof, by the actions and not the defense of those who come to judgment shall they be judged before the LORD.",
    "Take heed, O ye kohenim and judges, lest ye corrupt my name in judgment, for the world saith, “We shall go up to the LORD God at Jerusalem.” I shall hold him guilty of the punishment, he who goeth to the left or to the right of my judgment. I shall visit him with punishment in his life, and he shall not escape who tippeth the scales. So is the scale before the LORD: equal and even; he that taketh it shall be taken from that none may profit by deceit and treachery in the land. The LORD your God hath spoken."
