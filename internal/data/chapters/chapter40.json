    "THUS saith the LORD, The embalmer’s art doth speak. By strange practices the heart hath been preserved, though withered and empty. They who escaped of my people went thither unto the house of death, unto the artificer who preserveth, unto the vats of natron to be immersed therein. Thus they hid themselves from famine. Corruption did they not see, neither did they live and thrive.",
    "Therefore thus saith the LORD, I am against you, O ye Pious, the chief artisans of vanity. According to your vanity will I do unto you, and according to this will I accomplish your rebuke: Behold the crow and her kin. I have arrayed them in black that they might scavenge and not be desired. They come from their place with a loud noise, and no man careth for it. But a loud report sendeth them on their way. So are ye crows, and your conclaves the roostings of her kin: the magpie is black and white and hath a beak called beautiful; the raven maketh a threatening sound, and the rook appeareth wise. The jackdaw congregateth. But they are all scavengers of the odd and unusual, and all squawk an offensive sound. That which delighteth their eyes take they to their nest. So do you scavenge the words of the LORD, but only of those things which attract you, and so do you take them back to the place of your nesting and do nothing with them.",
    "Are not the master’s birds fed at his aviary? but the scavenger feedeth without. Bend your ear unto this condemnation, ye artificers: thus saith the LORD, your ways have arisen from the wilderness; your food was retrieved from the unfurrowed lands. I commanded Moses from Horeb, and I spoke through the Prophets, but spoke I not from the groves of your dispersion nor from the mountains of Poland. Keep your 613 ways, divide them as it is pleasing unto you, and at the time of your gathering unto your fathers ye shall say, “We are the flesh for which the seething is prepared.”"
